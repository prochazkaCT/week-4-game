# week-4-game

1. A random number is on the screen when you load the page 
2. There are 4 snowflakes on the screen 
3. Each snowflake is given a random number between 1-15
4. A new random number is generated every time you win or loose the game for each snowflake.  
5. When you click any snowflake - it will add to the previous result until it equals the total score 
6. If the total score is more than the random number, then the game starts over and you add a loss (total score > than the random number, loss++, game reset, numbers regenerated for random and snowflakes).
7. If the total score equals the random number, then a win is added and the game starts over (if total score === random number, win++, game reset, numbers regenerated for random and snowflakes).
 Good luck!!
